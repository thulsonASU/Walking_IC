# Walking_IC
I hope to remake a walking IC from a famous gif in the STEM community of an NE555N walking across a breadboard. I will document my ramblings and code here. :) <br/>



I will be making VLOGS and ranting in this README.md for the duration of this projects construction. Later I hope to be more organized, however, I truely, am not.
